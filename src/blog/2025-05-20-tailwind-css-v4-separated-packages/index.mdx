      Introduction of separated packages for the Tailwind CLI, PostCSS integration, and a newly introduced plugin for direct Vite support. Easier installation, fewer files, and more thoughtful dependencies.

};

## More packages - but why?

In Tailwind CSS v3, the `tailwind.config.js` file was still required. To make creating it easier, a CLI `init` process was available: `npx tailwindcss init -p`.

Starting with v4, the `tailwind.config.js` file is no longer needed (more on that here: <Link href="/blog/2025-05-25-tailwind-css-v4-css-first-configuration#what-is-the-css-first-configuration">What is the CSS-first configuration</Link>), and therefore the `init` process for generating it is no longer necessary either. As a result, there's no longer any justification to bundle the entire CLI ecosystem into every project - especially those that integrate Tailwind CSS via PostCSS or a Vite plugin instead of using the CLI.

### Separated package for Tailwind CLI

It made sense to separate the CLI into its own package, now named `@tailwindcss/cli`, which only needs to be installed by those who want to use the Tailwind CLI.

```sh
  # [!code filename:Terminal]
$ npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/cli
```

* [Install Tailwind CLI](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/tailwind-cli)

<div className="bg-blue-50 dark:bg-blue-950/50 border-l-4 border-blue-500/50 p-4">
  <strong>Note:</strong> Remember, the new separate official CLI command is: `npx @tailwindcss/cli`.

  ```sh
    # [!code filename:Terminal]
    # [!code --:2]
  $ npx tailwindcss -i input.css -o output.css
    # [!code ++:2]
  $ npx @tailwindcss/cli -i input.css -o output.css
  ```
</div>

### Separated package for PostCSS integration

Once the CLI was separated, it became obvious that the PostCSS plugin should also be isolated. It was moved into a separate package named `@tailwindcss/postcss`, which only needs to be installed by those integrating Tailwind via PostCSS.

```sh
  # [!code filename:Terminal]
$ npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/postcss postcss
```

* [Custom guide to Laravel Mix - Install Tailwind CSS using PostCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/framework-guides/laravel/mix)

<div className="bg-blue-50 dark:bg-blue-950/50 border-l-4 border-blue-500/50 p-4">
  <strong>Note:</strong> Accordingly, in your PostCSS configuration, you should now load the separated package as the plugin instead of the main package.

  ```js
  // [!code filename:postcss.config.mjs]
  export default {
    plugins: {
      // [!code --:4]
      "postcss-import": {},
      tailwindcss: {},
      autoprefixer: {},
      // [!code ++:2]
      "@tailwindcss/postcss": {},
    },
  };
  ```

  Due to the structure of the separated package, [there is no need for the `postcss-import` and `autoprefixer` packages](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/upgrade-guide#using-postcss) anymore.

  ```sh
    # [!code filename:Terminal]
  $ npm uninstall postcss-import autoprefixer
  ```
</div>

### New Vite plugin

Up to v3, Vite users could install Tailwind CSS via PostCSS. But this changed in v4, which introduced a dedicated plugin for direct Vite integration under the new package name `@tailwindcss/vite`. This means Vite users no longer need to rely on PostCSS to use Tailwind CSS.

```sh
  # [!code filename:Terminal]
  # If your Vite project does not exist yet
$ npm create vite@latest my-app-name
$ cd my-app-name

$ npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/vite
```

## Installation fails based on an old online tutorial

Accordingly, all official installation guides have been updated. However, caution is needed when following outdated, unofficial tutorials found online. Running `npm install tailwindcss` now installs the new v4 version, which no longer includes the `init` process and doesn't use `tailwind.config.js`, even if you create it manually.

```sh
  # [!code filename:Terminal]
  # Do not use it; just an example of incorrect usage starting from January 2025
$ npm install tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
$ npx tailwindcss init -p

> Error: tailwindcss not recognized
```

<div className="bg-blue-50 dark:bg-blue-950/50 border-l-4 border-blue-500/50 p-4">
  <strong>Note:</strong> If you follow a similar old - now outdated - installation step, you will end up installing Tailwind CSS v4 instead of v3, but you won't install any of the additional packages mentioned above. If you want to [use the PostCSS plugin as described in the v3 documentation](https://v3.tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-postcss), it won't work, and you will receive a warning indicating that something went wrong:

  > [postcss] It looks like you're trying to use tailwindcss directly as a PostCSS plugin. The PostCSS plugin has moved to a separate package, so to continue using Tailwind CSS with PostCSS you'll need to install `@tailwindcss/postcss` and update your PostCSS configuration

### How to install old Tailwind CSS v3?

If you want to follow guides written for Tailwind CSS v3, you must perform a version-specific installation, as now noted in the updated v3 documentation:

```sh
  # [!code filename:Terminal]
$ npm install tailwindcss@3
$ npx tailwindcss init
```

* [Get started with Tailwind CSS v3](https://v3.tailwindcss.com/docs/installation)
* [tailwindlabs/tailwindcss.com #2022 - Use `tailwindcss@3` in v3 docs](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss.com/pull/2022)

Although Tailwind CSS v3 installation often appears as the first recommendation in many places, I believe that if the browser support offered by v4 (which is quite broad but not critical) is acceptable for your project, you should definitely base your work on v4. It receives active maintenance and will continue to evolve in the coming times.
