  excerpt: (
    <>
      With the release of the new stable v4 version in January 2025, significant changes were introduced. One of the major updates is the deprecation of the legacy JavaScript-based configuration - which has existed since the beginning - in favor of a new CSS-first configuration based on CSS directives. As a result, switching to this new approach requires a deep dive into the differences between the old and new configuration methods.

  ),
};

## What is the CSS-first configuration

### Easier installation, fewer files

It means completely removing the well-known `tailwind.config.js` file. With Tailwind CSS v4, everything is fully customizable using new syntax directly within your CSS files. This also simplifies the installation process - there's no longer a need for an `init` step, which is why it's no longer present in v4.

### Introduction of separated packages for compatibility with different systems

As a result - and unless you're using the CLI - the CLI has been fully separated from the core package into its own standalone package. To stay consistent with this change, the PostCSS plugin has also been moved to a separate package. Starting with v4, there's even a dedicated Vite plugin, also provided as a new package.
You can read more about it here: <Link href="/blog/2025-05-20-tailwind-css-v4-separated-packages">

## Syntax

### New import, end of `@tailwind`

The first and most important change is how Tailwind CSS is implemented into your CSS. Previously, you had to include three separate `@tailwind` directives to add the necessary parts. Now, they've been consolidated, and all you need to do is this:

```css
/* [!code filename:main.css] */
/* [!code --:4] */
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
/* [!code ++:2] */
@import "tailwindcss";
```

This shortens the otherwise more verbose inclusion of the following parts:
```css
/* [!code filename:main.css] */
/* [!code --:4] */
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
/* [!code ++:6] */
@layer theme, base, components, utilities;

@import "tailwindcss/theme.css" layer(theme);
@import "tailwindcss/preflight.css" layer(base);
@import "tailwindcss/utilities.css" layer(utilities);
```

### CSS layers

If you're only superficially familiar with CSS, the use of native [`@import`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@import#syntax) now gives you the opportunity to understand the importance, [priority](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@layer#description), and application of [layers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@layer). In CSS, a priority hierarchy can be established between layers - the stronger layer will always override the weaker one.

However, there's one important thing to note: styles not placed inside any layer - so-called unlayered styles - are stronger than all layered styles.

Therefore, starting with v4, it's recommended to place your own custom styles under the `base` layer, and to make more frequent use of Tailwind CSS's `@utility` directive.
```css
/* [!code filename:CSS] */
/* [!code --:4] */
* {
  padding: 0;
}

/* [!code ++:6] */
@layer base {
  * {
    padding: 0;
  }
}
```

### Customize theme

In the `tailwind.config.js` file, the theme or theme.extend properties were typically used for this purpose. Now that the file has been removed, you need to familiarize yourself with the alternatives.

The following directives collectively replace full theme configuration - meaning you won't be able to solve everything using just `@theme`.

* [Functions and directives](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/functions-and-directives#utility-directive)

&nbsp;

Use the [`@theme`](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/functions-and-directives#theme-directive) directive primarily to customize core settings - based on the available [list of namespaces](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/theme#theme-variable-namespaces). Learn more about customizing your theme in the [theme variables documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/theme).

```css
/* [!code filename:CSS] */
@theme {
  --font-display: "Satoshi", "sans-serif";

  --breakpoint-3xl: 120rem;

  --color-avocado-100: oklch(0.99 0 0);
  --color-avocado-200: oklch(0.98 0.04 113.22);
  --color-avocado-300: oklch(0.94 0.11 115.03);
  --color-avocado-400: oklch(0.92 0.19 114.08);
  --color-avocado-500: oklch(0.84 0.18 117.33);
  --color-avocado-600: oklch(0.53 0.12 118.34);

  --ease-fluid: cubic-bezier(0.3, 0, 0, 1);
  --ease-snappy: cubic-bezier(0.2, 0, 0, 1);

  /* ... */
}
```

&nbsp;

You can declare your own variants using [`@custom-variant`](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/functions-and-directives#custom-variant-directive). Learn more about adding custom variants in the [adding custom variants documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/adding-custom-styles#adding-custom-variants).

* [Specially `@custom-variant` examples: How to access all the direct children of a div in Tailwind CSS?](https://stackoverflow.com/a/79426418/15167500)

```css
/* [!code filename:CSS] */
@custom-variant theme-midnight (&:where([data-theme="midnight"] *));
```
```html
<!-- [!code filename:HTML] -->
<!-- [!code word:theme-midnight\:bg-orange-500] -->
<div class="bg-sky-500 theme-midnight:bg-orange-500">...</div>
```

&nbsp;

These variants can then be used within CSS via the Tailwind CSS [`@variant`](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/functions-and-directives#variant-directive) directive. Learn more using variants in the [using variants documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/adding-custom-styles#using-variants).

* [How can I convert print: and screen: to the new `@theme` style?](https://stackoverflow.com/a/79432129/15167500)

/* [!code word:@variant\ dark] */
.my-element {
  background: white;

  @variant dark {
    background: black;
  }
}
```

&nbsp;

You can also create new dynamic utilities with [`@utility`](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/functions-and-directives#utility-directive). Learn more about registering custom utilities in the [adding custom utilities documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/adding-custom-styles#adding-custom-utilities).

```css
/* [!code filename:CSS] */
@utility tab-4 {
  tab-size: 4;
}
```

### Plugins

After installing plugins, you can reference them by name using the `@plugin` directive:

```css
/* [!code filename:CSS] */
@plugin "@tailwindcss/typography";
```

If the given plugin supports configuration, you can do it here:

```css
/* [!code filename:CSS] */
@plugin "daisyui" {
  themes: light --default, dark --prefersdark;
  root: ":root";
  include: ;
  exclude: ;
  prefix: ;
  logs: true;
}
```

  <strong>Note:</strong> As an example, I highlighted a popular Tailwind CSS plugin that showcases the versatility of the new plugin configuration in a comprehensive way.

</div>

## Is `tailwind.config.js` gone forever?

No. Although from v4 onward it is referred to as the _legacy JavaScript-based configuration_, implying that sooner or later it will be completely deprecated.

In v4, it is still possible to use it - although it does not fully replace the alternatives mentioned earlier. The theme property can still be used for customization. To do this, you need to use the [`@config`](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/functions-and-directives#config-directive) directive and provide the relative path from the current file to your `tailwind.config.js` file:

```css
/* [!code filename:CSS] */
@config "../../tailwind.config.js";
```

<div className="bg-red-50 dark:bg-red-950/50 border-l-4 border-red-500/50 p-4">
  <strong>Important:</strong> Dark mode (the `dark` property) and plugins (the `plugins` property) can no longer be applied from the configuration file. The `corePlugins`, `safelist`, and `separator` options from the JavaScript-based config are not supported in v4.0. Only the default styles can be overridden from there. Keep this in mind and perform the migration correctly.
</div>

### Dark mode

In v3, the behavior of dark mode (dark variant) could still be controlled using the dark property. From v4 onward, it is enabled by default based on the browser's prefers-color-scheme. To switch to manual control, you simply need to override the default variant using the [`@custom-variant`](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/dark-mode#toggling-dark-mode-manually) directive.

```css
/* [!code filename:main.css] */
@import "tailwindcss";

/* [!code highlight:2] */
@custom-variant dark (&:where(.dark, .dark *));
```

```html
<!-- [!code filename:HTML] -->
<!-- [!code word:dark\:bg-black] -->
<!-- [!code word:dark] -->
<html class="dark">
  <body>
    <div class="bg-white dark:bg-black">
      <!-- ... -->
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

Or with the `data-theme` attribute:

```css
/* [!code filename:main.css] */
@import "tailwindcss";

/* [!code highlight:2] */
@custom-variant dark (&:where([data-theme=dark], [data-theme=dark] *));
```

```html
<!-- [!code filename:HTML] -->
<!-- [!code word:dark\:bg-black] -->
<!-- [!code word:data-theme=\"dark\"] -->
<html data-theme="dark">
  <body>
    <div class="bg-white dark:bg-black">
      <!-- ... -->
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```
