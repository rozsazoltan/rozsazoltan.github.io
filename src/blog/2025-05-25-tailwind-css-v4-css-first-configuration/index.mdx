  excerpt: (
    <>
      With the release of the new stable v4 version in January 2025, significant changes were introduced. One of the major updates is the deprecation of the legacy JavaScript-based configurationâ€”which has existed since the beginning - in favor of a new CSS-first configuration based on CSS directives. As a result, switching to this new approach requires a deep dive into the differences between the old and new configuration methods.

## What is the CSS-first configuration

### Easier installation, fewer files

It means completely removing the well-known `tailwind.config.js` file. With Tailwind CSS v4, everything is fully customizable using new syntax directly within your CSS files. This also simplifies the installation process - there's no longer a need for an `init` step, which is why it's no longer present in v4.

### Introduction of separated packages for compatibility with different systems

As a result - and unless you're using the CLI - the CLI has been fully separated from the core package into its own standalone package. To stay consistent with this change, the PostCSS plugin has also been moved to a separate package. Starting with v4, there's even a dedicated Vite plugin, also provided as a new package.
