      Mixing `px` and `rem` in responsive design - especially in breakpoints - is a common mistake that leads to unexpected behavior and bugs. In this article, we break down why `rem` is the superior choice and show how to fix misconfigurations in Tailwind CSS v4.

## Why mixing `px` and `rem` is dangerous

When building responsive interfaces, developers often reach for familiar units like `px`. However, there's a fundamental problem when you start combining `px` with `rem` - especially for breakpoints. Let's get one thing clear:

- [`px`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Values_and_Units/Numeric_data_types#absolute_length_units) is **static**.
- [`rem`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length#rem) is **dynamic**, based on the root `font-size`.

When you mix them, you're opening the door to **inconsistencies**, especially when users (or you) change the root `font-size`. What looks right at `16px` might look wrong at `14px`. Tailwind's default breakpoints are `rem`-based for this reason - to allow **scalability**, **accessibility**, and **consistency**.

&nbsp;

<TipHighlight>
  I prefer Tailwind CSS, so this article uses it. To understand better, check out the new v4 CSS-first configuration: <Link href="/blog/2025-05-25-tailwind-css-v4-css-first-configuration#what-is-the-css-first-configuration">What is the CSS-first configuration</Link>
</TipHighlight>

Let's say you define a breakpoint like this:

```css
/* [!code filename:CSS] */
@theme {
  /* [!code highlight:2] */
  --breakpoint-lg: 1280px;
}
```

But Tailwind's built-in `xl` breakpoint is:

```css
/* [!code filename:CSS] */
@theme {
  /* [!code highlight:2] */
  --breakpoint-xl: 80rem; /* 80 * 16 = 1280px (by default) */
}
```

So far, so good - until someone changes the base `font-size` to `14px`. Now: `80 * 14 = 1120px`

Your `lg` breakpoint is now **larger** than `xl`, completely flipping your layout logic. Suddenly, `xl` kicks in **before** `lg`, and you're debugging styles that seem to override each other without reason. Worse, Tailwind treats `rem`-based breakpoints as **stronger**, so your `px` breakpoints get overridden silently.

<TipWarning>
  Since `rem` is dynamic, its value can't be calculated at compile time and can be influenced at runtime. Therefore, Tailwind CSS treats any `rem` value as stronger than any statically `px` value by default. This means an `sm` breakpoint declared with `1rem` will always override an `xl` breakpoint declared with `9999px`.
</TipWarning>

## But what if you must use `px` in Tailwind CSS?

Maybe you're working in a legacy system or need pixel precision for a specific project. If you choose to define your breakpoints in `px`, you **must** disable Tailwind's default `rem`-based breakpoints.

Here's how to safely do it in Tailwind v4:
<CodeExampleStack>
```css
/* [!code filename:CSS] */
@theme {
  /* [!code highlight:2] */
  --breakpoint-*: initial; /* Disable all rem-based breakpoints */
  --breakpoint-lg: 1080px;
  --breakpoint-xl: 1280px;

  /* [!code highlight:2] */
  --container-*: initial; /* Disable container breakpoints */
  --container-lg: 1080px;
  --container-xl: 1200px;
}
```

```html
<!-- [!code filename:HTML] -->
<!-- [!code word:@lg] -->
<!-- [!code word:lg] -->
<!-- [!code word:@xl] -->
<!-- [!code word:xl] -->
<div class="@container bg-sky-300 lg:bg-red-300 xl:bg-yellow-200">
  <div class="@lg:px-6 @xl:px-8">
    Responsive content
  </div>
</div>
```
</CodeExampleStack>

This ensures that your `px` breakpoints are not overridden by `rem`-based ones.

## Choose `rem` for the future

Using `rem` ensures:

<TipGood>
  <ins>Accessibility</ins>: Users can resize text, and your layout scales with it.
</TipGood>
<TipGood>
  <ins>Consistency</ins>: Tailwind's utilities align perfectly.
</TipGood>
<TipGood>
  <ins>Maintainability</ins>: No weird overrides or unit clashes.

You don't have to fight the browser. Let `rem` do the work.
