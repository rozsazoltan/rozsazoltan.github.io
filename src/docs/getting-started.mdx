export const description = "I publish the documentation of several personal PHP and JavaScript packages. On a shared documentation site, I also dedicate space to sharing my own stack and knowledge - such as development tools, extensions, CI/CD, version control, etc.";

## Structure

Each independent part is given its own subsection within the documentation. Each of these subsections will have its own version number. This way, although they function like separate documentations, I can maintain them under a unified look and feel. Since I operate as a one-person army and make my publications freely available, some sections may be slow to update or temporarily incomplete. I do my best to keep everything as up to date as possible.

## Pricing and Support

I primarily publish my packages and blog posts **free** of charge. If you like any of my public projects, please consider supporting them with at least a **GitHub star** - I believe this metric helps establish a project's credibility and encourages me to continue maintaining it.

## Contributing

If you happen to find an error or something missing, I warmly welcome any feedback via the documentation's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rozsazoltan/rozsazoltan.vercel.app).

## Sponsorship

On the documentation site, I try to offer space for promoting useful services, supporting those projects in the process. For now, I feature what I consider useful and interesting services and content free of charge, as long as they align with my personal values and standards.
